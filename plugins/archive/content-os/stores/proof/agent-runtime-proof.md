# Proof — Agent Runtime Architecture

Sistem:
- orchestrator + worker topology
- event-driven execution
- distributed memory bus

Sonuç:
- orchestration latency: 4.8s → 1.3s
- parallel execution gain: %62
- retry failure rate: %18 → %3

Ana sebep:
centralized planning yerine
distributed execution graph kullanılması.
